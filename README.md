Problem statement
Car dealerships face the challenge of determining optimal pricing for their newly acquired vehicles. While the Manheim Market Report provides suggested retail prices, these figures may not align with market demand or maximize profitability. As a result, dealerships must navigate the complexities of pricing to strike a balance between profitability and attracting buyers efficiently. 
 
Proposed solution
We propose the development of an advanced machine learning algorithm, utilizing regression, to predict optimal prices for vehicles based on the entered features. This predictive model will serve as the backbone of a user-friendly interface designed for car dealerships. Various sellers can enter pertinent details about a car they wish to sell, and immediately receive data-driven pricing recommendations.
Additionally, we would be integrating sentiment analysis into the pricing prediction process. This allows the model to dynamically adjust pricing recommendations based on historical customer sentiments.  By adjusting prices based on the emotional impact of specific features, as revealed in past customer reviews, our system seeks to provide pricing recommendations that are more precise, customer-centric, and competitive.
Why Model is Important
Car sales are down by 20% prices are still high.
An accurate evaluation of car prices is very important to maintain a healthy development of the car market. In this regard, we would like to predict car prices using one of the prediction methods, namely multiple linear regression. Using unfiltered data, we are going to identify the factors that affect car prices then create an equation that is able to predict a car’s price given its features and evaluate the data’s reliability.
For this reason, we aim to create a reliable Linear Regression model through the data provided.
For customers, knowing the reasonable price of the car can make them buy or sell used car with no worries; for car rental companies, predicting the residual value is useful for the pricing of their rental service; for banks and other financial institutions, evaluating the price of a lender’s car can help them control his or her loan quota. Thus, this is an important and interesting topic. Many researches have been done in recent years on predicting used car price with data mining. Many have built a used car price evaluating model for leasing companies with Supported Vector Machines.
